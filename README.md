# Rogatum

React app for generating reading comprehension questions from Latin text with gpt-3. Written by [diyclassics](https://github.com/diyclassics) in April 2023.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running app

You can start the app with:
`npm start`

NB: You need to place your openai api key in a file called .env.local with the name `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY`.
